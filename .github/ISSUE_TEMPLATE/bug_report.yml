        Please explain in as much detail what happened, e.g. crash or softlock
        and where you were and what you did prior to it. Be specific about which
        room you were in and what door you entered if necessary. You can press
        F6 in-game to display the room number you are currently in, but if you
        can't find it - say something such as "RPD, West 1F box room with licker
        window" or "Sewer room where you place the medals".
        If possible, please also upload the most recent saved game before the
        bug happened.
